                <h5 style="margin-left:20px;margin-top: 50px;">History</h5>
                <p class="discription" style=" margin-left:20px;text-align: justify;"> Alappuzha is one of the 14 districts in the Indian state of Kerala. It was formed as Alleppey district on 17 August 1957, the name of the district being changed to Alappuzha in 1990, and is the smallest district of Kerala.
                  It is one of the most popular museums in Alleppey. Built-in the 18th century by the king of Travancore, Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma, Krishnapuram Palace is quite popular for its vintage architecture and artistic murals.
                  In the 17th century the Portuguese power declined on the Malabar Coast and the Dutch Malabar gained a predominant position in the principalities of this district.[5] The church located at Kokkamangalam or Kokkothamangalam is believed to be one of the seven churches founded by St.
                   Thomas the Apostle, one of the twelve disciples of Jesus Christ according to the oral traditions. The picturesque CSI Christ Church in Alappuzha town was built in 1816 by the first CMS (Church Missionary Society) missionary to India, Rev.
                   Thomas Norton. It was the first Anglican Church to be established in the erstwhile state of Travancore.

                  Currently maintained by the Archaeological Department of Kerala, the palace is also home to the biggest mural painting of Kerala-- the 'Gajendra Moksha.’ The enriching mural painting covers an area of about 53 km, making this palace one of the most popular places to visit in Alleppey. .</p>

                        <p class="card-text">One of the best places to visit in Alleppey is Kuttanad Backwaters. This isn’t a place, it’s a phenomenon. It is a spectacular lagoon, surrounded by the beauty of lakes, rivers, canals, misty mountains and ethereal landscapes.

                          The experience of floating along the pristine backwaters on a houseboat is inexplicable. You will have to live it to know it! The place is also known as the ‘Rice bowl of Kerala,’ for its stunning rice plantations. If you are in Alleppey for a day, then this place should be your entire itinerary.

The lake is full of exciting possibilities- just imagine yourself floating on the lake early in the morning, sipping a hot cup of coffee and listening to the gentle lapping of the waves and chirping of birds.
                           Now that is peace and happiness!

                          <p class="card-text">Held in the memory of Jawaharlal Nehru, this boat race is unlike any other boat racing activity you may have seen before. The Nehru Trophy Snake Boat Race, also known as Vallam Kali, is an annual competition that takes place every August on a part of Lake Vembanad. It is one of the cultural highlights of the state, so plan your visit accordingly if it is your desire to see and experience this boat race. 

                            Unlike other boat racing events which have teams of 5 to 10 rowing furiously in silent concentration, this boat race has teams of at least 100 people, usually fishermen, who row together as they sing at the top of their voice. It is a wonderful experience to simply see the boats row past as you stand on the banks of the lake.If you feel like exploring and being offbeat, you could actually scout for the perfect secluded spot to watch the race on the banks of the lake.

                          </h5>
                          <p class="card-text">This famous church is known for celebrating huge feasts during the month of May. The church is also popular for its Christian and non-Christian pilgrims. The Vicar of this Palli was Father Thoman Olakkapady. Currently, the church is located close to the Mahatma Gandhi University’s St. Aloysius College which is built and managed by the church.

                            Since the church is located close to the below sea level area, therefore travelers can enjoy agricultural lands and rice farms that are seen separated through the rivers. The environs here are enchanting, with mud levees being used for separating runs which are nothing less than a highway or street that one would find in New York. A massive shrine at Edathua is located close by. The shrine features architecture similar to that of the churches in Medieval Europe.
                            
                            The church itself was built in 1st century AD and is said to be built by St. Thomas himself, who was a disciple of Jesus Christ. </p>
