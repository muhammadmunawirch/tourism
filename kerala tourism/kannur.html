                <h5 style="margin-left:20px;margin-top: 50px;">History</h5>
                <p class="discription" style="margin-left:20px;text-align: justify;">  History of Kannur starts with Mooshaka kings who ruled over Chirakkal and Kasargod areas with their capital at Mount Eli (Elimala or Ezhimala which literally translates to Rat Mountain). By 14th century A. D., the kingdom came to be known as Kolathunad and the rulers become known as Kolathiris. Kolathiris became prominent all over the north Kerala and were the rivals of Zamorins of Kozhikode. During that period several Arab scholars visited the places like Baliapatam, Srikantapuram, Dharamadam, Bekal and Ezhimala which they recorded in their travelogue.


                  The arrival of Vasco Da Gama, the Portuguese navigator changed the history of Kolathiris and India as a whole. Kolathiris were interested to acquire wealth and power with the help of Portuguese in order to compete with their rivals the Zamorins of Kozhikode who used to be aided by Arabs. Portuguese became successful in exploiting the rivalry of the neighbours they were able to erect forts in strategic points. The most important one was the St. Angelo's Fort in Kannur erected by Francisco De Almedia in 1505. Portuguese were able to intercept ships to Kozhikode thus establishing their supremacy in Indian seas.
