                <p class="discription" style="margin-left:20px;text-align: justify;">   The presence of numerous prehistoric megaliths and dolmens indicate that Thrissur has been occupied since at least 1000 BCE to 500 CE.

                    The Portuguese had naval influence in many parts of Kerala in the 16th century, including Thrissur. In the beginning of the 17th century the Portuguese naval power was reduced and Dutch became the main naval power. With the help of the Dutch, the royal family of the Kingdom of Cochin recaptured Thrissur from the Zamorin of Calicut in 1710.
                    
                    Thrissur rose to importance after Maharaja Sakthan Thampuran ascended the throne of Kingdom of Cochin (1769–1805) and made Thrissur his capital. The Maharaja made the city into a major financial and commercial hub of South India, by inviting Syrian Christian families and Brahmins from adjoining areas.
                    
                    During 1750–60 Hyder Ali, the Sultan of the powerful Kingdom of Mysore, conquered Thrissur, making it a tributary of Mysore. In 1786, the son of Tipu Sultan of Mysore led another invasion of Thrissur, but retreated after the Srirangapattanam war.
                    The Indian independence movement gained momentum after a Committee was formed at the 1919 meeting of the Indian National Congress. The civil disobedience movement attracted many people in Thrissur in subsequent years, and Mahatma Gandhi visited the city in 1927 and 1934 to promote it.
                    
                    R. K. Shanmukham Chetty, the controversial Diwan of Cochin Kingdom from 1935 to 1941, developed the city by constructing Thrissur Town Hall and Ramanilayam, buildings which remain important in Kerala politics. Thrissur district was formed on 1 July 1949, with the headquarters at the city of Thrissur.</p>

                            <p> On the outskirts of the city at a distance of some 60 km, the Athirappilly waterfalls mark one of the best places to visit in Thrissur. Standing 80 ft tall and about 330 ft wide, these falls are the largest in the state of Kerala.

                            The majesty of this place can be understood by the fact that the falls are located on the Chalakudy River, that originates from the highest mountain in India outside of the Himalayas. A perfect place for a group outing, these falls are sometimes called the Niagra of India </p>

                        <p class="card-text">Another gem on the Chalakudy River in the Athirappilly region of Kerala, the falls are located between two major tourist spots in the region; Athirappilly Falls and Vazhachal Falls. Not just that, the falls are also a midway stop for a number of tourists who are visiting the above falls.

                            The flow of the water on the rocks is as such that the water looks like milk flowing, further adding to the charm of this place. The waterfall is best visited in the months right after the monsoon season when the water spills onto the road nearby.

Their main focus has always been on the arts that have been developed in Southern India.

                            The Kerala Kalamandalam was what gave three main arts of Kerala a new life, namely Kathakali, Kudiyattam, and Mohiniyattam. For the sake of performing arts, and if you are someone who is a fanatic for them, this is definitely the place to be. The best part is that the institute is housed on the banks of the Bharathapuzha River.
