                <p class="discription" style="margin-left:20px;text-align: justify;">  Malappuram is one of the 14 districts in the South Indian state of Kerala. The district has a unique and eventful history starting from pre-historic times. During the early medieval period, the district was the home to two of the four major kingdoms that ruled Kerala. Perumpadappu was the original hometown of the Kingdom of Cochin, which is also known as Perumbadappu Swaroopam, and Nediyiruppu was the original hometown of the Zamorin of Calicut, which is also known as Nediyiruppu Swaroopam. Besides, the original headquarters of the Palakkad Rajas were also at Athavanad in the district.
                  During the colonial era, Malappuram was the headquarters of European and British troops and it later became the headquarters of the Malabar Special Police (M.S.P) formerly known as Malappuram Special Force formed in 1885 The British established the Haigh Barracks on top of the hill of Malappuram, at the bank of the Kadalundi river to station their forces, where once Tipu had a fort. Main Barracks has now been turned into the seat of the district administration as Civil Station, Malappuram. Malappuram was the headquarters of one of the five revenue divisions of erstwhile Malabar district, the others being at Thalassery, Kozhikode, Palakkad and Fort Cochin. Apart from the District Board at Calicut, Malappuram Taluk Board were one of the local boards constituted to manage the affairs in Malabar District along with Thalassery, Palakkad and Mananthavady (Wayanad) with jurisdiction corresponding to the divisional charges of the same names.

                        <p class="card-text">Another attraction of Malappuram that is often compared to the famous town of Ooty, Kodikuthimala is definitely a sight for the sore eyes. A hill station of Kerala, the place is perched on a height of about 522 m above sea level, and is the highest point in the Amminikkadan hills.

                          Once the spot where the Britishers once hoisted their flag, the spot was opened for tourism only a few decades ago, with a large area of the place marked already for future development projects. There is a watch tower on the top of the hill from where tourists can get a panoramic view. </p>

                        <p class="card-text">Arimbra Hills or Mini Ooty is one of the most scenic places to visit in Malappuram. The place is called mini Ooty because of its resemblance to the hill station of the same name, and a rather famous one at that.

                          Located at a height of about 1,050 feet above sea level, you can get a breathtaking view of the area around. Not just that, on the top of the hill, you can get to see a number of stone crushers, plantations, and a few Jain temples as well.

                          <p class="card-text">The River of Bharata, also known as Nila, the Bharathapuzha River is a west-flowing river in the state of Kerala, and is the second longest river in the state. The river has been an integral part of life in the southern regions of Malabar. The name Nila has been given to the river to show the importance of it being more than just a river, as there are several mentions of the river in the ancient Hindu scriptures.

                            All along the river, there are about 11 dams made to use its waters for the purpose of irrigation. Culturally, the river has an importance in a number of parts of the state, like the famous Kerala Kalamandalam which is housed on the banks of the river.

                            <p>A natural cascading waterfall, the Adyanpara is counted amongst the best of Malappuram tourist places. Located in in the Kurmbalangodu village of Nilambur district near Malappuram, the waterfalls are a seasonal delight.

                              In summers, the water runs dry and with a lesser flow, but are nonetheless similarly beautiful to look at. The waters of the falls descend down in a cascade over the rocks of the hill, with a rich variety of flora around it to make it look even more mesmerizing. </p>
