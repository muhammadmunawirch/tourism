                <h5 style="margin-left:20px;margin-top: 50px;">History</h5>
                <p class="discription" style="margin-left:20px;text-align: justify;">  Idukki district was formed on 26 January 1972. The district consists of Devikulam, Udumbanchola and Peermedu taluks of the erstwhile Kottayam district and Thodupuzha taluk (excluding two villages Manjallore and Kalloorkadu) of the erstwhile Ernakulam district. At the time of formation the district headquarters started functioning at Kottayam and from there it was shifted to Painavu in Thodupuzha taluk in June 1976, where it is proposed to build a new planned forest township.

                  The district's name, 'Idukki' is supposed to be derived from the Malayalam word 'Idukku' which means a narrow gorge. Periyar which is one of the largest rivers of Kerala, flowing through Idukki gorge formed between the two high massive rocks called "Kuravan" and "Kurathi", is the site of the gigantic Idukki arch dam.
                  
                  We have very little authentic knowledge which throws light into the ancient history of Idukki district. Eventhough there is no clear evidence whether men of the paleolithic age lived here, there is evidence of stone-age civilisation. Stone-age dolmens were discovered in the valleys of Anchanad in Devikulam taluk. Archaeological excavation conducted during 1947-48 at Kallar Pattom colony in Udumbanchola taluk and at Vandiperiyar in Peermedu taluk brought to light the remains of Old Stone-age Menhir and Tombs.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Sita Devi Lake, is located at an altitude of 1800 meters (5900 ft) above the sea level. The lake also referred to as Devikulam, which means lake of the Goddess, is supposedly linked to the epic Ramayana. According to the myth, it is said that Goddess Sita Devi, the consort of Lord Rama, had bathed in these waters.

                          Tourists prefer to take a dip in the waters of this lake, not only due to its sacredness but also because of the purported curative powers of its mineral waters. The distant cloud-capped the Blue Mountains, the velvety rolling evergreen hills, and the natural vegetation of slim red, blue, and yellow gum trees hypnotize the visitors.

                          <p class="card-text">The Idukki dam is constructed across the Periyar River, in a valley between the Kuravan and Kurathi hills in Kerala. The awe-inspiring, majestic dam, which stands at 167.68 meters (550 ft), is one of the highest arch dams in Asia. The dam, which is one of the Idukki tourist places, constructed by the Kerala government in 1975 and supports 780 MW hydroelectric power station that draws electricity from this dam.

                            The sheer magnitude of the structure along with the mountains, verdant vegetation, and 60 sq. km placid lake, which is created by the 3 dams, Idukki dam, Cheruthoni and Kulamavu, captivate the visitors.

                        <p class="card-text">Thommankuthu Waterfalls is a series of 12 falls or kuthus (locally known) spread over an area of 5 kms and fall from a height of 40 meters. The 12 falls that vary in height and pass through the lush evergreen forests, presents a remarkable sight.

                          The waterfall is eponymous of its founder, Thommachan Kuruvinakunnel, who introduced this beautiful falls to the world. The rich flora and fauna around the waterfall hypnotize the visitors. It is an alluring destination for trekking as it takes you through caves and sleepy hamlets of the tribals.The visitors can enjoy a bath at the falls in summer, but not during the monsoon as the level of water increases.

                          </h5>
                          <p class="card-text">Mangala Devi temple is a historic temple situated in the dense forests of Periyar Tiger Reserve in the Idukki district of Kerala bordering Tamil Nadu State. The fable prevalent among the natives elucidates that Kannagi, a devout Tamil woman, had wreaked destruction on the Pandyan dynasty through her curse for unjustly executing her husband, Kovalan in a theft case.

                            Kannagi is extolled as the epitome of chastity and is bestowed the position of the goddess. The ancient Tamilakam King, Chera Chenguttuvan, constructed this temple, around 2000 yrs ago. So, the temple is known for Pandiyan architecture.
                            
                            Apart from Mangala Devi, the idols of Lord Shiva, Lord Karuppuswamy and sanctorium of Ganesh adorn the temple. </p>
